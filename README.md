### Python Turtle
I recently came across this classic lib which was largely built to be used for logo designing.
It reminded me of a very similar tasks I used as my first programming tasks using Visual Basic then. I am sharing few of the tasks I enjoyed while going around with the funcs of this library. Will definitely merge if you got any intresting ideas working with turtle.
